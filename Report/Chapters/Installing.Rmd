# Installing Julia and the REPL

## Installing Julia

Julia can be downloaded in executable form from the [Julia Language Downloads webpage](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Its is available for Windows, OS X and Linux in both 32- and 64-bit format. As of the time of writing of this document, the Current Release of the language was v0.6.2. 

## Windows

The latest Julia release is available for 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and later. to install, users should follow the following steps:

1. Download the corresponding Windows julia.exe installer from the [Julia Downloads webpage](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Run the downloaded executable file to extract Julia in a reasonable destination folder, such as `C:\julia`.
3. Double click the Julia shortcut inside the recently unpacked folder.

Additional [steps](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/README.windows.md) are required to succesfully run Julia in Windows.

## macOS

On macOS 10.8 and later releases, these steps should be followed to succesfully install Julia:

1. Download the `Julia-<version>.dmg` file provided in the [Julia Downloads webpage](https://julialang.org/downloads/). This file contains the Julia app.
2. Installation is identical to that of any other applications in macOS; just copy the `Julia-<version>.dmg` to the hard-drive or run from the disk image.

As an alternative, you can also install Julia directly from your terminal using the following command:

`brew cask install julia`

## Linux

Although there are Linux Distribution-Specifica Packages available for Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and Scientific Linux, it is recommended to install the official generic Linux binaries from the [Julia Downloads webpage](https://julialang.org/downloads/) because the former may not use the right versions of Julia dependencies nor include important patches the official binaries ship with.

In order to install the generic Linux binaries, you need to follow these steps:

1. Extract the `tar.gz` file downloaded from the [Julia Downloads webpage](https://julialang.org/downloads/) to any folder on your computer.
2. Add Juliaâ€™s `bin` folder to your system `PATH` environment variable.
3. Invoke the Julia executable by using its full path, as in `<where you extracted Julia>/bin/julia`.

This means that, in order to create a symbolic link inside the `/usr/local/bin` folder, you should type the following command on the terminal:

`sudo ln -s <where you extracted the julia archive>/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia`

## REPL

If you are using either Windows or macOS, you can run Julia from a menu or desktop icon, whereas if you are using Linux, you should type `julia`
